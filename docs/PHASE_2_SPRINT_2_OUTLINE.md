# Phase 2 - Sprint 2 Outline & Planning

**Date**: June 14, 2025
**Sprint**: Phase 2 - Sprint 2
**Duration**: 2 weeks
**Foundation**: 53% coverage, 238 passing tests from Sprint 1

## Sprint 2 Mission: MCP Integration & L1→L2 Memory Pipeline

**Objective**: Transform the cc module into the "gold standard" with complete MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and L1→L2 memory pipeline, creating the perfect template for all future COS modules.

**Key Principle**: The cc module will have "ALL FEATURES/OPTIONS/POSSIBILITIES" wired and ready. Other modules generated from cc can then "de-tune, turn off, comment out" features they don't need (e.g., PEM might have read-only mode, other modules might disable MCP entirely).

---

## Core Deliverables

### 1. MCP Server Implementation (Primary)
**Goal**: Full Model Context Protocol server in cc module

#### MCP Tools (High-Level Agent Operations)
```yaml
# cc/mcp/tools/
├── health_tools.py        # get_system_health, check_module_status
├── module_tools.py        # create_module, configure_module, restart_module
├── memory_tools.py        # query_l1_memory, search_events, get_insights
├── coordination_tools.py  # cross_module_sync, publish_event, subscribe_events
└── maintenance_tools.py   # cleanup_ttl, optimize_indexes, backup_data
```

#### MCP Resources (Structured Data Access)
```yaml
# cc/mcp/resources/
├── system_state.py        # Live system configuration and status
├── memory_streams.py      # L1/L2 memory data streams
├── module_config.py       # Dynamic configuration access
└── performance_metrics.py # Real-time performance data
```

#### MCP Prompts (Agent Guidance)
```yaml
# cc/mcp/prompts/
├── system_diagnostic.py   # Guide agents through health analysis
├── memory_analysis.py     # Help agents understand memory patterns
└── module_management.py   # Assist with module lifecycle operations
```

### 2. L1→L2 Memory Pipeline (Secondary)
**Goal**: Automated transformation of raw events into semantic knowledge

#### L1: Enhanced mem0_cc Schema
- Event logging with rich context
- TTL management and cleanup
- Cross-reference tracking
- Performance optimization

#### L2: Neo4j Graph Integration
- Semantic transformation service
- Entity extraction from L1 events
- Relationship building between concepts
- Knowledge graph emergence

#### Pipeline Components
```python
# cc/services/
├── memory_pipeline.py     # L1→L2 transformation orchestration
├── semantic_extractor.py  # Extract entities/concepts from events
├── graph_builder.py       # Build Neo4j relationships
└── insight_generator.py   # Generate semantic insights
```

### 3. Template Enhancement for Module Generation
**Goal**: Prepare cc as the ultimate template for all future modules

#### Full Feature Matrix
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Advanced querying with filters, pagination, sorting
- ✅ Background task processing
- ✅ TTL data management with cleanup
- ✅ Redis pub/sub for cross-module communication
- ✅ Comprehensive health monitoring
- ✅ Performance metrics and benchmarking
- ✅ MCP server with tools/resources/prompts
- ✅ L1→L2 memory pipeline
- ✅ Graph database integration
- ✅ Real-time event streaming
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Security and validation layers

#### Configurable Components
All features will be controlled via environment variables and configuration, allowing future modules to:
- **Disable MCP**: `ENABLE_MCP=false` (for simple modules)
- **Memory-only mode**: `ENABLE_GRAPH=false` (just L1 storage)
- **Read-only mode**: `ENABLE_WRITE_OPERATIONS=false` (for reporting modules)
- **Minimal mode**: Multiple flags for lightweight deployments

- Memory access tools (query L1, search events)
- System coordination tools (pub/sub integration)

### Week 2: Memory Pipeline & Polish
**Days 6-8**: L1→L2 Pipeline
- Enhanced mem0_cc schema with semantic markers
- Neo4j integration service
- Automated transformation pipeline
- Event replay and error recovery

**Days 9-10**: Integration & Template Preparation
- End-to-end MCP + memory pipeline testing
- Configuration framework for feature toggling
- Documentation for module generation
- Performance optimization and benchmarking

## Sprint 2 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] MCP server responds to capabilities requests
- [ ] At least 5 functional MCP tools implemented
- [ ] L1→L2 pipeline processes events automatically
- [ ] Neo4j graph shows semantic relationships from L1 data
- [ ] Cross-module communication via Redis pub/sub working
- [ ] All features configurable via environment variables

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] Maintain 53%+ test coverage baseline
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all new functionality
- [ ] Zero ruff/mypy errors
- [ ] API response times <300ms P95
- [ ] MCP compliance validated via automated testing

### Template Requirements

- [ ] Feature toggle framework operational
- [ ] Clear documentation for enabling/disabling features
- [ ] Module generator script ready for cc template usage

## Integration with Remaining Technical Debt

Sprint 2 will also address remaining P2-* patterns as infrastructure matures:

### P2-CONNECT-001 & P2-ALEMBIC-001
- Real database integration enables these patterns
- Focus on L1→L2 pipeline implementation
- ~2 additional tests to be enabled

### Continuing Coverage Improvement
- **Target**: 53% → 65%+ through new feature testing
- **Method**: Comprehensive testing of MCP and memory pipeline features
- **Quality**: All new code at 97%+ coverage

---

## Long-Term Vision Alignment

### "20 Best Versions of Kevin" Enablement
With Sprint 2 completion, LLM agents will have:
- **Standardized Access**: MCP provides uniform interface to all COS capabilities
- **Deep Context**: L1→L2 pipeline creates semantic understanding
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Pub/sub enables immediate cross-module coordination
- **Unlimited Scope**: No feature limitations - full creative intelligence substrate

### Multi-Century Architecture
The cc "gold standard" approach ensures:
- **Future Modules**: Can inherit all capabilities or subset as needed
- **Technology Evolution**: MCP abstraction layer protects against obsolescence
- **Graceful Scaling**: Features can be enabled/disabled based on requirements
- **Preservation**: Knowledge graph captures and preserves intellectual work

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Complexity**: Start with simple tools, build incrementally
- **Performance Impact**: Benchmark all new features against Sprint 1 baseline
- **Integration Challenges**: Extensive testing with mock and real databases

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Management**: Focus on core MCP + memory pipeline, defer advanced features
- **Quality Gates**: Maintain 53%+ coverage baseline, no regression tolerance
- **Complexity Creep**: Stick to essential features for Sprint 2, enhance in later sprints

---

## Next Actions

1. **Branch Setup**: Create Sprint 2 feature branch from current main
2. **Task Breakdown**: Create detailed .taskmaster tasks for 2-week sprint
3. **Infrastructure**: Ensure all development dependencies ready
4. **Cursor Prompting**: Prepare comprehensive Sprint 2 cursor prompts with MCP context

**Ready to Begin**: Sprint 2 can start immediately with clear objectives and solid foundation.
