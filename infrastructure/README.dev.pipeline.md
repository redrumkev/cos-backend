# 📡 Pipeline Infrastructure – Developer README

Located: `G:/cos/src/infrastructure/`

This file scaffolds the infrastructure setup for the **Pipeline** — the forward-facing distribution layer of the NEXUS system.

---

## 🌍 What is the Pipeline?

The Pipeline is the *external arm* of COS:

- It distributes, broadcasts, and packages the ideas, teachings, and outputs generated by COS.
- Can include:
  - Web frontend (Next.js / React)
  - Outbound publishing agents
  - External APIs
  - Streaming/queue layers
- It must be able to operate **independently**, but when connected to COS, it should sync deeply.

---

## 🚧 Status

Pipeline is not yet fully constructed. This README serves as:

- A placeholder for infrastructure decisions
- A reminder of the interface boundaries between COS and Pipeline
- A guide for future agentic developers or IDEs to reason modularly

---

## 🧠 COS ↔ Pipeline Communication Principles

- Run on **separate Docker networks**
  - COS: `cos_network`
  - Pipeline: `pipeline_network`
- Allow communication only via **shared interface services**
  - e.g. REST gateway, Redis pub/sub, queue
- Do **not** assume COS is always online

---

## 📦 Services (Future Planning)

- [ ] `frontend_pipeline`: Next.js site for idea publication
- [ ] `api_gateway`: Shared REST interface for content access
- [ ] `pubsub_bridge`: Optional message relay between COS and external services

---

## ✨ IDE/Agent Note

If you're reading this file, you're likely helping build or extend the Pipeline.

- Honor modular independence
- Bridge only when needed
- Ask: **"Would Pipeline still function if COS was offline?"**

If not — rethink the dependency.
