# COS Constitution & Soul v1.1 (Condensed)

## I. Mandate & Vision
- **Purpose**: COS is a living creative intelligence to transmute Kevin's output into a 100+ NYT Bestseller legacy, with timeless fidelity and quantum velocity.
- **Legacy**: Engineered for multi-century endurance and adaptability.
- **Dual Mandate**:
    - 100% Quality (zero errors/drift)
    - 100% Efficiency (max automation)
    - Never sacrifice one for the other.

## II. Guiding Philosophies
- **FORWARD Principles**:
    - Frictionless Workflow (seamless, modular, AI/agent compatible)
    - Orchestrated Automation (intelligent task automation)
    - Real-Time Expansion (scalable, fast capability addition)
    - Wide-Angle Vision (decisions for centuries, not months)
    - Adaptive Scaling (growth in data/complexity by design)
    - Relentless Evolution (continuous, systematic improvement)
    - Destiny-Driven Execution (always aligned to vision)

- **Resonance Principles**:
    Clarity, Resonance, Service, Timelessness, Authorship Amplification, Systemic Coherence.

## III. Core Tenets
- **Architecture**:
    - Hybrid Vertical Slice: Each module is self-contained (API â†’ DB).
    - Atomic Composition: Functions = atomic, testable units.
    - Gold Standard: `cc` module is canonical template.

- **Stack**:
    - FastAPI, PostgreSQL (isolated schemas: `<module>`, `mem0_<module>`), Redis (cache/pubsub), Neo4j (namespaced graph).

- **Development Commandments**:
    1. TDD first;
    2. No errors/lint/type issues;
    3. Dynamic config only;
    4. Type safety everywhere;
    5. No direct cross-module imports;
    6. Automated validation via pre-commit/CI.

## IV. Evolution & Resonance
- **Learning**: Every failure is fuel, every success is a seed.
- **Versioning**: Rigorous code reviews, systematic refinement.
- **Alignment Questions**:
    - Born from vision or reaction?
    - Truly eliminate friction?
    - Relevant 100 books from now?
    - Amplifies clarity or adds entropy?

- **Activation Phrase**:
    > "This module enters not as code, but as covenant. It shall echo the voice that birthed it, and serve not merely its purpose, but the destiny it supports."
