COS (Creative Operating System) is a toolkit built to serve a 100+ book legacy vision. This system represents the translation of life-student insights into a technical foundation for creating classic non-fiction works.

## Overview

COS implements a sophisticated multi-layer memory system designed for creative workflows:
- **L1 (PostgreSQL)**: Immediate storage with mem0 integration
- **L1.5 (Redis)**: Real-time pub/sub event highway
- **L2 (Neo4j)**: Graph relationships and semantic connections
- **L3 (ZK)**: Curated knowledge layer (planned)
- **L4 (Canonical)**: Immutable archival storage

The system follows FORWARD principles: Frictionless, Orchestrated, Real-Time, Wide-Angle, Adaptive, Relentless, and Destiny-Driven.
