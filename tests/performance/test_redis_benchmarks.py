# Test file - configured per-file ignores in ruff.toml handle common test patterns
"""Redis Performance Benchmarking Suite - Task 011.

This module implements comprehensive performance benchmarks for Redis operations
to validate the dual mandate requirements:

Performance Targets (Single-Developer Optimized):
- Publish latency < 1ms (functional validation focus)
- Throughput ≥ 500 msg/s (practical for single-dev hardware)
- Connection pool efficiency (500 pings < 1s)
- Memory leak detection (functional validation)
- Regression monitoring in CI/CD

All benchmarks use simple time.perf_counter for reliable measurement and
fast CI execution. Optimized for MacBook Air + workstation hardware.
