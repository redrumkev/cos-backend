			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create Redis Configuration Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the Redis configuration module into subtasks such as: defining configuration constants, implementing environment variable validation, handling development vs. production settings, configuring the connection pool with optimal defaults, and integrating pydantic for validation and type safety.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves configuration management, environment handling, and type validation, which are moderately complex but well-scoped. The use of pydantic and environment-specific logic adds some complexity, but the task is largely configuration-focused rather than algorithmically complex."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Redis Pub/Sub Wrapper",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks such as: implementing async Redis client with connection pooling, developing publish and subscribe methods, integrating error handling, adding logging with Logfire, managing connection pool lifecycle, and writing unit tests with Redis mocking.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires asynchronous programming, connection pooling, low-latency requirements, error handling, and logging integration. The need for robust testing and performance targets increases its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern",

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Base Subscriber Abstract Class",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks: defining the abstract base class, implementing start/stop consuming logic, designing the process_message contract, adding message acknowledgment and error recovery, and supporting batch processing and dead letter queues.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves abstract class design, concurrency, error handling, and extensibility for future consumers, making it moderately complex."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the enhancement into subtasks: modifying log_l1 to publish after DB commit, implementing the _publish_l1_event helper, ensuring error isolation, integrating Logfire spans, and writing integration tests for the new flow.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Redis publishing into an existing service with transactional guarantees, error isolation, and tracing adds significant complexity, especially in ensuring failures do not impact the main API."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Standardized Message Format",

			"taskTitle": "Create Enhanced Debug Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into subtasks: extending the /debug/test-log endpoint, implementing /debug/redis-health, adding message inspection, integrating performance metrics, and ensuring compatibility with existing debug infrastructure.",
			"reasoning": "Developing debug endpoints with real-time health and performance monitoring involves API design, integration with Redis, and metrics collection, making it moderately complex."
