### Key Changes Summary
1. Redis Pub/Sub Highway implementation
2. CC Gold Standard achievement (100% test target)
3. Database configuration unification
4. Performance optimizations

## 5. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Monitor CI completion: https://github.com/redrumkev/cos-backend/actions
2. Investigate test failures in CC module cleanup functionality
3. Address high concurrency test failures
4. Review performance test thresholds

### PR Merge Prerequisites
1. All CI checks must pass
2. 1 approval required (per branch protection)
3. All conversations resolved
4. Squash merge commit message finalized

### Post-Merge Actions
1. Delete `feature/db-config-unification` branch (manual)
2. Delete `release/phase2-sprint2` branch after merge to main
3. Tag release for Phase 2 Sprint 2 completion
4. Begin Phase 2 Sprint 3 planning

## 6. Technical Notes

### CI Configuration Insights
- Multiple workflow files trigger on PR to main
- Parallel test execution across different categories
- Integration tests include Redis version compatibility (6.2, 7.0, 7.2)
- Performance regression tests included

### Branch Protection Impact
- Cannot push directly to main
- PR required with approval
- Linear history enforced (no merge commits)
- All CI checks must pass before merge enabled

## 7. Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
1. **Test Failures**: Multiple categories failing in CI
2. **Time Pressure**: 55% through test suite with 20 failures
3. **Cleanup Functionality**: Mem0 cleanup feature appears broken

### Mitigation Strategy
1. Focus on CC module cleanup test fixes first
2. Evaluate if performance thresholds need adjustment
3. Consider temporary test skips with tracking issues
4. Ensure no regression in core functionality
