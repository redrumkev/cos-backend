summary: Gold-standard COS module. Sets precedent for all others.
description: |
  The Control Center (cc) module defines the COS backbone.
  It sets the standard for structure, logging, testing, and routing.
  All future modules must follow this pattern.
pattern:
  requirements:
    - Follow COS dev standards with >95% test coverage
    - Mount under /api/v1/cc/ in cos_main.py
    - Include passing /health endpoint at /api/v1/cc/health
    - Use log_event() on all route/controller entry points
    - Maintain human-readable and agent-friendly code
    - Co-locate cc_manifest.yaml and cc_map.yaml
examples:
  - startup:
      file: cos_main.py
      content: "app.include_router(cc_router, prefix='/api/v1/cc')"
  - logging:
      file: router.py
      content: "log_event(source='cc', data={...})"
  - testing:
      file: tests/backend/test_cc.py
      content: "health endpoint test coverage"
