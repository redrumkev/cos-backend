      # For clarity, ensure redis.conf IS using ${REDIS_PASSWORD} from the environment.
      # Docker Compose passes .env variables to the container's environment,
      # and redis.conf can substitute them if it's processed by an entrypoint script
      # or if Redis itself supports env var substitution in its config file loading.
      # A common pattern is for the Redis image's entrypoint to handle this.
      # If not, you might need to use `env_file: .env` directly in the service definition
      # OR ensure the command explicitly passes it if the conf file cannot substitute.
      # For redis/redis-stack, simply having REDIS_PASSWORD in the container's env
      # and `requirepass ${REDIS_PASSWORD}` in redis.conf should work as the image
      # often has an entrypoint script that processes the .conf file.
