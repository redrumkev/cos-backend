# Current Sprint: Phase 2 Sprint 2 - Redis Pub/Sub Highway

## Constitutional Principles (Never Compromise)

### Dual Mandate (Constitutional Law)
**100% Quality + 100% Efficiency** - Never sacrifice one for the other. Every decision must honor both. If forced to choose, we've designed wrong. This principle applies to code, documentation, workflows, and creative output.

### FORWARD Principles (Technical DNA)
- **Frictionless**: Standard structures, rapid scaffolding, zero manual deployment
- **Orchestrated**: Intelligent automation with human-in-the-loop oversight
- **Real-Time**: New capabilities in <1 day, zero downtime expansion
- **Wide-Angle**: Decisions for centuries, not sprints
- **Adaptive**: 10x growth without performance degradation
- **Relentless**: Every failure is fuel, every success is seed
- **Destiny-Driven**: All code serves the 100+ book legacy vision

## Sprint Context
**Sprint Status**: IN PROGRESS
**Dependencies**: Sprint 1 âœ… (L1 memory foundation complete)
**Current Focus**: L1 â†’ Redis â†’ L2 event pipeline implementation

## Core Deliverables This Sprint
- `common/pubsub.py` async Redis wrapper
- Publish hook in `log_l1()` â†’ `mem0.recorded.cc` channel
- Generic subscriber base class
- Integration tests: round-trip < 5ms local

## Sprint Constraints
- Only modify files within scope: common/, backend/cc/services/, tests/
- Must maintain 97% unit test coverage
- All Redis operations must be async
- No changes to Sprint 1 deliverables unless critical bug
- Performance requirement: publish < 1ms latency

## Current Architecture State
âœ… L1 (mem0_cc): PostgreSQL schema with BaseLog, PromptTrace, EventLog
âœ… Logfire: Request tracing with request_id propagation
âœ… Testing: DELTA/EPSILON/ZETA methodology established
ðŸ”„ L1.5 (Redis): Event bus implementation IN PROGRESS
ðŸ“‹ L2 (Neo4j): Planned for Sprint 3
ðŸ“‹ L3 (ZK): Planned for Phase 3+
