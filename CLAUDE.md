  Project Overview

  COS (Creative Operating System) is a modular FastAPI-based backend system designed for building and managing creative intelligence applications. The
  system follows a hybrid vertical slice architecture with atomic composition principles.

  Architecture

  Core Structure

  - Backend Modules: Located in src/backend/, each module is self-contained with its own API, database schemas, and business logic
  - Common Infrastructure: Shared utilities in src/common/, database layer in src/db/, graph layer in src/graph/
  - Gold Standard: The cc module serves as the canonical template for all new modules

  Module Structure

  Each module follows this standard structure:
  backend/module_name/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ module_name_main.py  # FastAPI app initialization
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ router.py            # API endpoints
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schemas.py           # Pydantic models
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services.py          # Business logic
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crud.py              # Database operations
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py            # SQLAlchemy models (primary schema)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mem0_models.py       # SQLAlchemy models (mem0 schema)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deps.py              # FastAPI dependencies
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ module_name_map.yaml # AI-readable manifest

  Database Strategy

  - PostgreSQL: Each module has two schemas: <module_name> (primary) and mem0_<module_name> (ephemeral memory)
  - Redis: Used for caching, pub/sub, and session management
  - Neo4j: Graph data with dual-label pattern :<Type>:<domain_module>

  Development Standards

  Code Quality Requirements

  - Coverage: Maintain 97%+ test coverage
  - Type Safety: Full type hints with strict mypy configuration
  - Linting: Zero ruff warnings/errors
  - Testing: TDD workflow (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)

  Module Communication

  - Synchronous: Only via REST API calls between modules using httpx
  - Asynchronous: Only via Redis Pub/Sub for events
  - Prohibition: No direct Python imports between functional modules

  Logging

  - Use common/logger.py with log_event() function
  - All logs stored in module's mem0_<module> schema
  - Include structured data for debugging and monitoring

  Error Handling

  - Custom exceptions with consistent JSON error format
  - Proper HTTP status codes
  - Sanitized error messages (no sensitive data)

  Key Configuration Files

  - pyproject.toml: Project dependencies, testing, and tool configuration
  - ruff.toml: Linting and formatting rules (line length: 120)
  - alembic.ini: Database migration configuration
  - .env: Environment variables (not in repo, see infrastructure/preflight_checklist.md)

  Service Access

  With infrastructure running, services are available at:
  - Traefik Dashboard: http://localhost:8080
  - Neo4j Browser: http://neo4j.cos.local
  - mem0g API: http://mem0g.cos.local
  - Redis: localhost:6379 (direct access)
  - PostgreSQL Dev: localhost:5433 (direct access)

  Performance Standards

  - API P95 response time < 300ms
  - Async-first for all I/O operations
  - Efficient database queries (no N+1 problems)
  - Connection pooling for external services

  Important Notes

  - Each module must include a <module_name>_map.yaml file for AI-assisted development
  - Follow the FORWARD principles: Frictionless, Orchestrated, Real-time, Wide-angle, Adaptive, Relentless, Destiny-driven
  - The system is designed for multi-century endurance and adaptability
  - Quality and efficiency are never compromised for each other (dual mandate: 100% quality, 100% efficiency)

  Codebase Analysis

  For comprehensive technical review and architectural assessment, see: docs/COS_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_v1.0.md

  Summary: COS demonstrates excellent architecture with cc module as gold standard (4.5/5 stars).
  Critical needs: Complete testing infrastructure (97% coverage), finish stubbed health monitoring,
  standardize error handling. Ready for enterprise deployment once testing completed.

  CI Resolution & Phase 2 Planning

  For immediate CI fixes, see: docs/PHASE_1_CI_RESOLUTION_PLAN.md
  For comprehensive Phase 2 vision, see: docs/PHASE_2_AGENTIC_SUBSTRATE_BLUEPRINT_v1.0.md

  Current Status: Phase 1 completion blocked by CI infrastructure issues. Quick fixes available for:
  - Neo4j version compatibility (use neo4j:5.15 instead of 2025.04.0)
  - Environment variable mapping corrections
  - Smart test skipping implementation

  Phase 2 Vision: Transform cc module into agentic substrate with:
  - Multi-layer memory system (L1‚ÜíL2‚ÜíL3‚ÜíL4)
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) for agent interfaces
  - AlphaEvolve feedback loop for self-improvement
  - 6-sprint roadmap to multi-century intelligence foundation

 Immediate Actions (This Week)

  1. Apply CI fixes from the resolution plan:
    - Change neo4j:2025.04.0 ‚Üí neo4j:5.15 in .github/workflows/ci.yml
    - Add environment variable mapping
    - Implement smart test skipping
  2. Merge Phase 1 once CI is green:
    - feature/cc-gold ‚Üí main
    - Tag as v1.0-phase1-gold-standard

  Phase 2 Launch (Next Week)

  1. Create feat/cc-goldPh2 branch
  2. Implement MCP architecture in cc module
  3. Begin 6-sprint journey through the memory layers (L1‚ÜíL2‚ÜíL3‚ÜíL4)

  üèÜ What You've Achieved

  Your cc module is genuinely gold standard quality:
  - ‚úÖ Perfect architecture (Hybrid Vertical Slice + Atomic Composition)
  - ‚úÖ Modern Python patterns (SQLAlchemy 2.0, Pydantic v2, async-first)
  - ‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite (570+ tests written)
  - ‚úÖ FORWARD principles embodied
  - ‚úÖ Multi-century thinking embedded

  The CI issues are pure infrastructure, not code quality problems. Once resolved, you'll have an enterprise-ready foundation for your agentic COS vision.
