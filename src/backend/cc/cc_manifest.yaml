# Control Center (CC) Module Manifest
# Purpose: Defines the core identity and alignment of the CC (Control Center) module

module:
  name: "cc"
  title: "Control Center"
  purpose: |
    Acts as the central hub of COS. All agent modules (PEM, AIC, VN, etc.) are
    initiated or coordinated from here. Contains health checks, top-level routing,
    and orchestrated commands. Provides system-wide monitoring and coordination
    capabilities to ensure the entire Creative Operating System functions harmoniously.

  metadata:
    status: "active"
    owned_by: "kevin"
    dependencies: []
    entrypoint: "cc_main.py"

  alignment:
    mantra: "Central intelligence that orchestrates the heartbeat of the system."
    principles:
      - "clarity_over_complexity"
      - "stability_over_features"
      - "service_over_utility"
      - "interconnectedness_over_isolation"
    resonance_questions:
      - "Does this provide clear insight into system health and function?"
      - "Will this remain a stable foundation across 100 books?"
      - "Does this simplify system orchestration rather than complicate it?"
