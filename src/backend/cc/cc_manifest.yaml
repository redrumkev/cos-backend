# Control Center (CC) Module Manifest — v1.1
# Purpose: Enhanced identity and alignment of the CC module within COS under the Dual Mandate

module:
  name: "cc"
  title: "Control Center"
  purpose: |
    Acts as the central hub of COS. All agent modules (PEM, AIC, VN, etc.) are
    initiated or coordinated from here. It provides API endpoints, high-integrity CRUD operations,
    orchestrated routing, and system-wide monitoring. `cc` operates as the operational gateway
    between frontend/editor surfaces and the system’s memory and logic layers.

  metadata:
    version: "1.1"
    status: "active"
    owned_by: "kevin"
    dependencies: []
    entrypoint: "cc_main.py"

  alignment:
    mantra: "Central intelligence that orchestrates the heartbeat of the system."
    principles:
      - clarity_over_complexity
      - stability_over_features
      - service_over_utility
      - interconnectedness_over_isolation
    resonance_questions:
      - "Does this provide clear insight into system health and function?"
      - "Will this remain a stable foundation across 100 books and 1000 workflows?"
      - "Does this simplify system orchestration rather than complicate it?"

  responsibilities:
    - Expose typed RESTful API endpoints for structured operations
    - Act as the entry point for UI modules like Milkdown and tldraw
    - Interface with mem0, Postgres, Neo4j as backend truth layers
    - Publish real-time updates to Redis pub/sub
    - Normalize, persist, and broadcast system state updates
    - Provide a gold standard template for future COS modules

  non_responsibilities:
    - Prompt engineering (delegated to PEM)
    - Agentic decision-making (delegated to AIC)
    - Graph clustering/insight logic (delegated to Graphiti)
    - Voice intake, transcription, or Slack classification

    - name: "CRUD Gateway"
      description: "Accepts structured create/update requests from editors and modules"
    - name: "Event Sync"
      description: "Publishes Redis notifications for downstream agentic subscribers"

  integrations:
    - name: "mem0"
      purpose: "Short-term memory persistence and coordination"
      interface: "HTTP API / pubsub"
    - name: "Postgres"
      purpose: "Long-term structured data storage"
      interface: "SQLAlchemy ORM"
    - name: "Neo4j / mem0g"
      purpose: "Graph-based memory and connection reasoning"
      interface: "Cypher / Graphiti layer"
    - name: "milkdown"
      purpose: "Frontend Markdown editor interface"
      interface: "REST API calls to /cc endpoints"
    - name: "tldraw"
      purpose: "Visual layout editor and graph-mapping tool"
      interface: "JSON sync via /cc/visual endpoints"

  extensibility:
    modules_downstream:
      - pem:
          role: prompt engineering and enhancement of entries, zk, outlines
      - aic:
          role: agentic decision support, synthesis, judgment and trajectory feedback
      - graphiti:
          role: graph-wide analysis, link emergence, tag harmonization, theme discovery
      - slack:
          role: user-input intake, classification, agentic routing, NLP feedback
      - rituals:
          role: apply transformation logic and resonance weighting to entries or workflows
      - zk:
          role: long-term structured note architecture (can extend `cc/zk/` or specialize further)
      - publishing:
          role: export, format, distribute final works (book, article, evergreen content, etc.)

  future_extensions:
    - /cc/log/ → transparent event auditing
    - /cc/meta/ → cross-module metadata resolution
    - /cc/bridge/ → cc → external system relay (Notion, Git, Drive, etc.)

  alignment_with_dual_mandate:
    quality:
      - All exposed endpoints are typed, versioned, and scoped to minimal intention
      - Composable route design with shared validators
      - Avoids side effects, uses pure-state logic with pub/sub triggers
    efficiency:
      - Can be cloned to new module via script/template
      - Minimal boilerplate due to re-used CRUD factory classes
      - Configurable schema paths, tags, and state handlers

      priority: "high"
    - name: "Command Queue"
      description: "Task queue for asynchronous operations"

      priority: "low"
    - name: "Metadata Map Service"
      description: "Surface insight into all known ZK/Book/Prompt/Agentic entities"
      priority: "high"

  notes:
    - "If `cc` begins accumulating logic that belongs to PEM, AIC, or another cognitive module, it must be immediately migrated."
    - "Use `cc` as an operational gateway, not intellectual authority."
    - "cc = interface; others = intelligence."
    - "This manifest defines the ideal state of the module — deviations must be intentional and documented."
    - "This template logic is reusable across COS and Pipeline for hub modules that orchestrate, but do not interpret or transform data themselves."
