# SQLAlchemy Test Isolation Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The `reset_sqlalchemy_mappers` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` was causing test isolation issues by calling `clear_mappers()` and `Base.metadata.clear()` between tests. This removed the `__table__` attributes from SQLAlchemy model classes, causing subsequent tests to fail.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. `clear_mappers()` removes all SQLAlchemy mapper registrations
2. This includes removing the `__table__` attribute from model classes
3. Re-importing models after clearing doesn't restore the table definitions
4. Tests that depend on model table attributes would fail

## Evidence
- Test failures: "AttributeError: 'HealthStatus' has no attribute '__table__'"
- Test failures: "TypeError: 'module' is an invalid keyword argument for HealthStatus"
- Tests passed individually but failed when run together
- First test in a sequence would pass, subsequent tests would fail

## Solution Applied
Modified the `reset_sqlalchemy_mappers` fixture to disable the problematic `clear_mappers()` call:
- Commented out the mapper clearing logic
- Added explanation about why it was causing issues
- Noted that transaction rollback in `db_session` fixture provides sufficient isolation

## Results
- `test_models.py`: Fixed - all 17 tests now pass (previously 12 failures)
- Overall cc module: Improved from 158 failures to 26 failures
- The remaining failures appear to be unrelated to the mapper isolation issue

## Test Matrix After Fix
| Test Combination | Result |
|-----------------|---------|
| test_models.py alone | ✅ All pass |
| test_models.py in cc suite | ✅ All pass |
| Individual model tests | ✅ All pass |
| Multiple model tests together | ✅ All pass |

## Next Steps
The remaining 26 failures in the cc module appear to be related to different issues (SQLAlchemy query construction errors) and would need separate investigation.
