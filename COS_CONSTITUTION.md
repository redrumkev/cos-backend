# COS Constitution - Working Document

*This is a living checklist that will evolve into declarative operating principles. As items are completed, they will be compressed to 1-2 line summaries. When all items are implemented, this document will transform into "This is how COS operates."*

## Foundation: The Dual Mandate (Never Compromise)
**100% Quality + 100% Efficiency** - Every decision must honor both. If forced to choose, we've designed wrong.

## ACTIVE IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Pattern System Foundation

- [ ] **Establish Living Patterns System**
  - [x] Create patterns philosophy document
  - [x] Initialize pattern library structure
  - [x] Document decision in ADR-002
  - [ ] Research and implement core patterns:
    - [ ] Service pattern (Context7/Tavily research)
    - [ ] Async handler pattern
    - [ ] Error handling pattern
    - [ ] Dependency injection pattern
    - [ ] Model pattern
    - [ ] Router pattern
    - [ ] Database operations pattern

- [ ] **Pattern Enforcement Workflow**
  - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with pattern-first directives
  - [ ] Create pre-commit hook for pattern compliance
  - [ ] Add pattern validation to CI pipeline
  - [ ] Document pattern review process

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: Gold Standard Implementation

- [ ] **Core Module Analysis & Refactor**
  - [ ] Deep-dive analysis of /common/ module
  - [ ] Apply KISS principle throughout
  - [ ] Ensure all code follows established patterns
  - [ ] Document all refactoring decisions in ADRs

- [ ] **CC Module Gold Standard**
  - [ ] Complete feature wishlist implementation:
    - [ ] Slack integration
    - [ ] MCP folder/logic setup
    - [ ] MEM0 integration optimization
    - [ ] Real-world test infrastructure
    - [ ] Minimal auth system
  - [ ] Add E2E test harness (Playwright/Puppeteer)
  - [ ] Ensure MCP server/client functionality
  - [ ] Implement stateless/stateful design decisions

### ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Development Workflow Optimization

- [ ] **True TDD Implementation**
  - [ ] Enforce red-green-refactor cycle
  - [ ] ~10 line test increments
  - [ ] Always green before commit
  - [ ] Document TDD patterns

- [ ] **CI/CD Evolution**
  - [ ] Simplify GitHub Actions to backup-only
  - [ ] Prepare Mac Studio M4 Max CI infrastructure
  - [ ] Implement tiered testing (fast local, full integration)
  - [ ] Create failure summary system (no log flooding)

- [ ] **Git Workflow Standardization**
  - [ ] Feature branches: feat/*
  - [ ] Release candidates: release/*
  - [ ] Protected main branch
  - [ ] Squash working commits before merge

### ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Multi-Module Architecture Preparation

- [ ] **Module Structure Definition**
  - [ ] Finalize module roles (CC, PEM, AIC, etc.)
  - [ ] Define inter-module communication (Redis pub/sub)
  - [ ] Create module template from CC gold standard
  - [ ] Document module creation process

- [ ] **Infrastructure Readiness**
  - [ ] Dockerization strategy
  - [ ] Security/auth framework (JWT/YAML switches)
  - [ ] Multi-environment CI setup
  - [ ] Production deployment patterns

### ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Continuous Improvement Systems

- [ ] **Feedback Loops**
  - [ ] Logfire integration for observability
  - [ ] AlphaEvolve implementation
  - [ ] User analytics framework
  - [ ] A/B testing infrastructure

- [ ] **Knowledge Management**
  - [ ] ADR review schedule
  - [ ] Pattern effectiveness metrics
  - [ ] Documentation update workflow
  - [ ] Team knowledge sharing process

## COMPLETED PRINCIPLES (Compressed Summaries)

*As items are completed, they will be moved here with 1-2 line summaries*

### âœ… Foundation Principles
- **ADR System**: Architecture decisions documented in `.cursor/adr/` for transparent technical evolution

### âœ… Development Standards
- **Progressive Coverage Floor**: 79% minimum (current - 2%), enabling confident refactoring

---

## FORWARD PRINCIPLES (Our Technical DNA)

These remain constant throughout all phases:

- **Frictionless**: Standard structures, rapid scaffolding, zero manual deployment
- **Orchestrated**: Intelligent automation with human-in-the-loop oversight
- **Real-Time**: New capabilities in <1 day, zero downtime expansion
- **Wide-Angle**: Decisions for centuries, not sprints
- **Adaptive**: 10x growth without performance degradation
- **Relentless**: Every failure is fuel, every success is seed
- **Destiny-Driven**: All code serves the 100+ book legacy vision

---

## TRANSFORMATION TIMELINE

**Current State**: Active checklist with ~40 items
**3 Months**: ~20 items completed, 20 compressed to principles
**6 Months**: ~35 items compressed, 5 final items
**Target State**: 100% declarative "This is how COS operates"

---

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

1. **Daily**: Check active items, mark progress
2. **Weekly**: Compress completed items to summaries
3. **Monthly**: Review transformation progress
4. **Quarterly**: Assess if ready for final declarative form

Remember: This document tracks our journey from aspiration to automaticity. Every checked box is a step toward operational excellence that requires no thoughtâ€”just execution.
