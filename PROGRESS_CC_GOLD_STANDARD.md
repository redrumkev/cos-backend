# CC Gold Standard Progress

## Sub-Agent C: Core V2 Package Structure and Logger Migration

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Created Core V2 Package Structure
- ✅ Created `/src/core_v2/__init__.py` with package documentation
- ✅ Created `/src/core_v2/utils/__init__.py` with proper exports
- ✅ Created `/src/core_v2/patterns/__init__.py` for future patterns

#### 2. Migrated Logger Module
- ✅ Copied `src/common/logger.py` to `src/core_v2/utils/logger.py`
- ✅ Enhanced with:
  - Improved type hints (added `LogEventResponse` TypedDict)
  - Better documentation with comprehensive docstrings
  - Maintained full async support
  - Kept the same interface for backwards compatibility

#### 3. Created Shim Import
- ✅ Modified `src/common/logger.py` to import from `core_v2.utils.logger`
- ✅ Added deprecation notice with migration instructions
- ✅ Re-exported all symbols for backwards compatibility
- ✅ Included `_demo` function for test compatibility

#### 4. Updated Tests
- ✅ All existing logger tests continue to pass (57 tests total)
- ✅ Created `test_logger_shim.py` with 7 tests verifying:
  - Both import paths work correctly
  - Functions are the same objects
  - Functionality is preserved
  - Type hints are available
- ✅ Created `test_logger_async_shim.py` with 5 tests verifying:
  - Async functionality works from both imports
  - Sync-in-async context handling works
  - Type safety with async functions

### Migration Pattern Established

The logger migration demonstrates the Strangler Fig pattern:
1. New enhanced code in `core_v2/`
2. Original location becomes a shim
3. All tests pass with no breaking changes
4. Clear deprecation path for future removal

### Next Steps for Other Modules

This pattern can now be followed for migrating other modules:
- Configuration module
- Middleware components
- Service abstractions
- Database utilities

The core_v2 structure is ready to receive additional migrations following ADR-001.
