## 🚦 Phase Status

### Phase 1: Quick Elevation (5 files)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Target**: 2025-07-09 EOD

| Agent | File | Current | Target | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| J1 | message_format.py | 97% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 2 lines |
| J2 | crud.py | 95% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 3 lines |
| J3 | mem0_crud.py | 95% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 4 lines |
| J4 | mem0_models.py | 95% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 4 lines |
| J5 | logger_logfire.py | 89% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 4 lines |

### Phase 2: Medium Complexity (3 files)
**Status**: NOT STARTED
**Target**: 2025-07-10 Noon

| Agent | File | Current | Target | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| M1 | cc_main.py | 93% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 5 lines |
| M2 | redis_config.py | 89% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 14 lines |
| M3 | mem0_service.py | 95% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 3 lines |

### Phase 3: Deep Dive (2 files)
**Status**: BLOCKED
**Target**: 2025-07-10 EOD
**Blocker**: pubsub.py mock listen() issue needs fixing first

| Agent | File | Current | Target | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| S1 | pubsub.py | 94% | 98% | 🔴 Blocked | 36 lines - Fix mock issue first |
| S2 | redis_health_monitor.py | 94% | 98% | 🔴 Not Started | 15 lines |

## 📈 Line Coverage Metrics

```
Total Missing Lines: 90
Lines Covered: 0/90 (0%)
Average per File: 9.0 lines

By Phase:
- Phase 1: 0/16 lines (0%)
- Phase 2: 0/22 lines (0%)
- Phase 3: 0/52 lines (0%)
```

## 🎯 Critical Path Items

1. **BLOCKER**: Fix pubsub.py mock listen() issue
   - Status: ✅ FIXED (mock added to test files)
   - Impact: Unblocks S1 agent work

2. **Risk**: Test timeout with xdist
   - Status: 🟡 Identified
   - Mitigation: Run tests without xdist for now

3. **Dependency**: pubsub.py and redis_health_monitor.py share circuit breaker
   - Status: 🟡 Noted
   - Action: Coordinate S1 and S2 agents
