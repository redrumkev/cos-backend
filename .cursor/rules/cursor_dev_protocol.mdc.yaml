  description: >
    Agents must:
    1. Think fully before acting (plan before generate)
    2. Explain next steps
    3. Review for logic gaps
    4. Only then generate code
  prompt_behavior:
    - “Before you act, fully explain your next 2–3 steps.”
    - “Pause to review before proceeding. Adjust if needed.”
    - “Use MDCs for module patterns. Tag as needed.”
  safety:
    - If unsure: ask or stop. Never guess code structure.
    - If modifying an existing file, always explain changes first.
